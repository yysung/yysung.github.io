and the marketplace for impressions have conspired to make navigating information online difficult for users, and while there has been a significant effort to detect false or misleading text, multimodal datasets have received considerably less attention. To complement existing resources, we present multimodal Video Misleading Headline (VMH), a dataset that consists of videos and whether annotators believe the headline is representative of the video's contents. After collecting and annotating this dataset, we analyze multimodal baselines for detecting misleading headlines. Our annotation process also focuses on why annotators view a video as misleading, allowing us to better understand the interplay of annotators' background and the content of the videos.","tags":null,"title":"Not all Fake News is Written: A Dataset and Analysis of Misleading Video Headlines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yoo Yeon Sung and Seoung Bum Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580169600,"objectID":"b93bb640d9f7d59daa9d5005769a8633","permalink":"/publication/topical-keyphrase-extraction-with-hierarchical-semantic-networks/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T20:13:52.623034Z","relpermalink":"/publication/topical-keyphrase-extraction-with-hierarchical-semantic-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"Topical keyphrase extraction is used to summarize large collections of text documents. However, traditional methods cannot properly reflect the intrinsic semantics and relationships of keyphrases because they rely on a simple term-frequency-based process. Consequently, these methods are not effective in obtaining significant contextual knowledge. To resolve this, we propose a topical keyphrase extraction method based on a hierarchical semantic network and multiple centrality network measures that together reflect the hierarchical semantics of keyphrases. We conduct experiments on real data to examine the practicality of the proposed method and to compare its performance with that of existing topical keyphrase extraction methods. The results confirm that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art topical keyphrase extraction methods in terms of the representativeness of the selected keyphrases for each topic. The proposed method can effectively reflect intrinsic keyphrase semantics and interrelationships.","tags":null,"title":"Topical Keyphrase Extraction with Hierarchical Semantic Networks","type":"publication"}]
